# **JavaScript Variables and Control Structures: Temperature Metric Converter**

## **IFS L1T06 - Capstone Project 1: Variables and Control Structures**

## **Description**
This is a temperature metric converter using HTML and JavaScript.

In this program, the user inputs a metric and temperature they want converted, and the metric they want to convert to.
The program then converts the inputted metric and temperature to the selected metric's temperature, using
an 'if...else' statement, and outputs a string stating both the inputted temperature and converted temperature (e.g. 0°C is 32°F).

## **Installation and Setup**
1. Clone the repo and open with your preferred IDE (e.g. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)).
2. In the IDE, open the temperature.html file and click the 'run' button, or click 'Go Live' if using VSCode. 
This should open your browser automatically to your localhost port number with '/temperature.html' as the URL endpoint.
